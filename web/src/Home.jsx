        Australia proudly uses a Preferential Voting system for electing its
        House of Representatives and a Proportional Representation system for
        electing its Senate, which give electors a lot of power and flexibility
        in deciding how to cast their vote. And while these systems are
        amazing for allowing electors to vote for their preferred candidate
        without fear of "wasting" their vote, it can be hard in practice for
        electors to understand how their vote is counted.
